<!-- Instructions for adapting this boilerplate to a new project: -->

<!-- 2. Replace "baz" with the name of your project.
        You should be able to do this with search and replace;
        making sure that the search is case insensitive and
        that the case of the replacement matches the case
        of the string found. In Emacs, query-replace will do this
        when case-fold-search and case-replace are both non-nil
        and both search and replacement string are given in lower case. -->

<!-- 4. You can use the patch-from-parent script to semi-automate
        merging future changes to the boilerplate with your file:
        http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/www/server/standards/patch-from-parent?root=www&content-type=text%2Fplain
        -->

<!-- If you would like to make sure your page validates with HTML5, that
     would be a good thing.  To do that, change the first line from
     to /server/html5-header.html before trying the validation.  Maybe
     someday we will be able to make /server/header be HTML5.  -->
